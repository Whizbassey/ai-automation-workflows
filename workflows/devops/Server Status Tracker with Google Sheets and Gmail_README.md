# Server Monitor with Email Alerts

## Overview
This workflow keeps an eye on your servers by checking if they're running every minute.  
When a server goes down, it automatically sends you an email alert and logs everything to Google Sheets.  

ðŸ‘‰ It's like having a security guard for your servers that never sleeps!

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheet
1. Create a new Google Sheet called **`Server-Monitor`**  
2. Add three tabs:  
   - `Server_List` â†’ Put your server IPs here  
   - `Server_Status_Alive` â†’ For healthy servers  
   - `Server_Status_Down` â†’ For problem servers

### Step 2: Import the Workflow
1. Copy the **JSON file** content  
2. Go to **n8n** â†’ click **Import from File**  
3. Paste the JSON and **save**

### Step 5: Test and Activate
- Test the workflow manually first  
- Check if **emails work properly**

## How It Works
- The workflow runs **every minute** and checks each server in your list.  
- If a server responds, it marks it as **Alive** in the sheet.  
- If it doesn't respond, it sends an **email alert** and logs it as **Down**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Simple as that!
